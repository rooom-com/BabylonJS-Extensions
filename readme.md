# Rooom's Custom HTML Mesh

This is a custom version of the [BabylonJS HtmlMesh](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/tree/master/packages/dev/addons/src/htmlMesh) package used by [Rooom](https://www.rooom.com).

To access the relevant source code switch to the [custom-htmlmesh-2](https://github.com/rooom-com/BabylonJS-Extensions/tree/custom-htmlmesh-2) branch.

### Publishing

To publish a new version of the package, create a new tag with the version number and push it to the `custom-html-2` branch. The CI will automatically publish the package to npm. Be aware that version in package.json must be the same as the tag.
